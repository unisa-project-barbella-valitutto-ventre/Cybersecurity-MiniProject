# Problem Description
The integration work consists of a mini project related to [Proximity Tracing DP-3T protocol](https://github.com/DP-3T/documents), with the following target: the Government Authority is using a decentralized contact tracing system, like DP-3T, and wants to do a modification to have on the Server a counter of the risk notifications displayed on users' devices.</br>
The main aspects of this project are:
* identify *Privacy* and *Integrity* properties.
* design a mechanism for risk notification counter.
* analyze the design with respect to properties.
* implement a small module that show the mechanism.

The collection of these data would help the optimization process of resources allocation. In fact, estimating the number of users that the system will notify can help the National Health Service to allocate its availabilities efficiently for fight Covid-19.
